      <h1>Welcome to About Me and My Project!</h1>
      <h1>(I'm Mitchell Nelson)</h1>

        <h3>Project Description:</h3> This project is a display for TV shows and
        movies, Its main purpose is to show where I am proficient and deficient
        in React JS I will fetch information from the given API and display
        information on the Entertainment options.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Industry Goals:</h3>
        My goal is to become a component full stack web developer. This way I
        can hopefully find employment that will pay well and allow me to work
        from home so I can spend more time with my family, and live in an area
        that suits our wants and needs. I also plan to have property with
        animals a small farm where my kids can learn how to have fun outdoors
        and learn practical life lessons. This job and skill will hopefully
        enable that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Things Learned at DevPipeline:</h3>I have learned so much at
        DevPipeline, I have learned Coding foundations, FE development and agile
        work structure, I have also learned how to better manage stress, how to
        break up projects into more managable pieces and How to enjoy the
        process of learning more then I have in the past. I have learned how
        important a good work culture is to success. I have learned more than
        this list but for the sake of brevity I will leave these examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Favorite Language:</h3>
        Right now my favorite Language is SCSS. I enjoy the work of styles and
        the instant feedback you can get when using styles. I also have been
        enjoying react but I need to get it down better before I can give an
        exact answer on if that is my favorite.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>My Projects:</h3>I have built several Projects durring my time at
        dev pipline. I have built Several widgets in React JS. One of my
        favorites was a color slider program where I would render a color to a
        box using 3 sliders that would select a number between 0 and 255 then
        using the 3 numbers it would render the corresponding color. I have
        build a binary calculator (Python), Rendered a christmas tree that would
        grow in size based on input (Python), I recreated a Site using html and
        css. I built a random student picker machine that would render to the
        DOM. And several others but those are some of my favorite.
